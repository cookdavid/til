## Microsoft Teams Keyboard Shortcuts

The amount of times I have to say to someone during a Microsoft Teams meeting "I can't hear you - you're on mute" has prompted me to become very familiar with the keyboard shortcuts. The most important ones are:

- Mute/unmute - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd>
- Turn camera on/off - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd>
- Blur background - <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>

## Using OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) as a video source for Microsoft Teams

OBS allows me to setup multiple scenes making use of either multiple webcams, desktop applications or combining them together in picture-in-picture type scenarios.

- Install [NDI Tools](https://ndi.tv/tools/)
- Install the [NDI Plugin for OBS](https://github.com/Palakis/obs-ndi/releases?WT.mc_id=-blog-scottha)
- When you run OBS after installing the NDI plugin, go to Tools, NDI Output Settings and select Main Output
- Then run Virtual Input and right click on it in the tray (near the clock) and set it's output to the computer name | OBS
- From within Teams, in the settings select NewTek NDI Video as the webcam
